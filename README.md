Grade 12 Assignment for Lists and Sets Data Types

There are 3 parts to this assignment.

ListsAndSetsProb1.java is the program that addresses the first part of the assignment. The program allows user to view the number of distinct substrings from any strings the user inputs from a file.


ListsAndSetsProb2Main.java as well as Fraction.java are the classes that address the second part of the assignment. 
ListsAndSetsProb2Main.java does the following:
- Program allows to set a maximum denominator and view the number of fractions that have a denominator no greater than the one the user inputted falling between 0 and 1.
- Program also asks for a range of fractions, and the program will output the number of fractions that fall inside that range. 
Fraction.java does the following:
The Fraction.java class is used to create Fraction objects.

ListsAndSetsProb3.java is the program that addresses the third and final part of the assignment. This program does the following:
- Program provides a simple GUI that allows user to view a deck of cards numbered 1 to 25(number of cards set by the user) that have been modified according to specific actions:
-     (1) The top card of the deck of cards is displayed
-     (2) The following card is moved to the bottom of the deck
-     (3) The following card is displayed
-     (4) The following card is moved to the bottom of the deck
- The above process is repeated until all cards in the deck are displayed. 
- Assuming that all the cards in the deck are placed in consecutive order from 1 to the last card, the program finds the original order of the cards.
